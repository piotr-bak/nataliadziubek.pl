## NATALIA DZIUBEK COACH WEBSITE

Repository of my first React project, created in early 2022.
This was a website for a business of Natalia Dziubek, coach from Gdynia - running until late 2023.
Design by Natalia Możdżeń.

##### Why is it here?
A remembrance token :) 
As this was my first React implementation for a commercial Client (and the Client don't mind) - I decided to keep it here. 
I learned quite a lot on this one, I could see what I like (React and its declarative nature) and what I like not-so-much (Tailwind. At time of development, it works like a breeze. But if you comeback to your code sometime later, the utility classes clutter is hard to see through).

##### **Stack:** React, Tailwind CSS

##### **In order to run:**

```javascript
  npm install
  
  npm run start
  ```
##### Runs at http://localhost:3000/
